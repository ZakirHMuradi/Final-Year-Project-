# Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Leishmaniasis using CNN and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project presents an innovative **machine learning-based diagnostic tool** for the early detection and outbreak prediction of **Leishmaniasis**. By integrating **Tranfer Learning**,and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to enhance accuracy, improve diagnostic speed, and support health authorities in forecasting outbreaks, especially in resource-limited regions such as Afghanistan.

## Key Features
- **Automated Diagnosis**: Detects **Leishmania parasites** in microscopic images using **CNN-based and other deep learning model**.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compares model accuracy against traditional diagnostic methods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web-based application for health officials to perform disease predictions easily.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Utilizes cloud computing for scalability and accessibility.

## Objectives
1. Develop a **CNN-based model** and **Transfer Learning** for early **Leishmaniasis diagnosis** using microscopic image datasets.
2. Improve diagnostic speed, particularly in **low-resource settings**.
3. Compare the model’s performance with **conventional diagnostic techniques**.
4. Develop an intuitive **software interface** for **non-expert users**.

## Tech Stack
### Programming and Frameworks
- Python (for Machine Learning and Deep Learning)
- TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn (for model development)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Streamlit (for web-based application)

### Deployment
