# Early Diagnosis and Prediction of Leishmaniasis using CNN and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project presents an innovative **machine learning-based diagnostic tool** for the early detection and outbreak prediction of **Leishmaniasis**. By integrating **Tranfer Learning**,and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to enhance accuracy, improve diagnostic speed, and support health authorities in forecasting outbreaks, especially in resource-limited regions such as Afghanistan.

## Key Features
- **Automated Diagnosis**: Detects **Leishmania parasites** in microscopic images using **CNN-based and other deep learning model**.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compares model accuracy against traditional diagnostic methods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web-based application for health officials to perform disease predictions easily.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Utilizes cloud computing for scalability and accessibility.

## Objectives
1. Develop a **CNN-based model** and **Transfer Learning** for early **Leishmaniasis diagnosis** using microscopic image datasets.
2. Improve diagnostic speed, particularly in **low-resource settings**.
3. Compare the model’s performance with **conventional diagnostic techniques**.
4. Develop an intuitive **software interface** for **non-expert users**.

## 📌 Business Benefits

### ✅ Improved Health Monitoring
By accurately predicting leishmaniasis outbreaks, health agencies can take preventive measures, reducing infection rates and improving overall health outcomes *(Zare et al., 2022).*  

### 💰 Cost Savings
Proactive outbreak prediction can reduce healthcare costs by optimizing resource distribution and minimizing the need for reactive emergency responses *(Zare et al., 2022).*  

### 📊 Data-Driven Decision Making
The system will enable health authorities to allocate resources—such as vaccines, diagnostic tools, and personnel—more effectively in vulnerable areas based on timely predictions.  

### 🌍 Support for Non-Endemic Regions
As global travel increases, non-endemic countries are seeing more cases of imported leishmaniasis *(Mansueto et al., 2014).* This system could help monitor and predict outbreaks in these regions, providing an early warning system to contain the disease's spread.
