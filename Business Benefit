# 🌍 Leishmaniasis Outbreak Prediction System

## 📌 Business Benefits

### ✅ Improved Health Monitoring
By accurately predicting leishmaniasis outbreaks, health agencies can take preventive measures, reducing infection rates and improving overall health outcomes *(Zare et al., 2022).*  

### 💰 Cost Savings
Proactive outbreak prediction can reduce healthcare costs by optimizing resource distribution and minimizing the need for reactive emergency responses *(Zare et al., 2022).*  

### 📊 Data-Driven Decision Making
The system will enable health authorities to allocate resources—such as vaccines, diagnostic tools, and personnel—more effectively in vulnerable areas based on timely predictions.  

### 🌍 Support for Non-Endemic Regions
As global travel increases, non-endemic countries are seeing more cases of imported leishmaniasis *(Mansueto et al., 2014).* This system could help monitor and predict outbreaks in these regions, providing an early warning system to contain the disease's spread.
